# rx1_gripper_hardware
Gripper hardware files for the rx1 humanoid robot.
Compatible with Feetech STS3215 servo and other Feetech servo with the same form factor.  
  
Tips: When using the gripper, sending a low torque limit value (for example 300, meaning 30% of the maximum torque) to make sure it doesn't crash the object it's grasping.
